Tuesday: Fix known bugs. 

Wednesday: Group meeting, discuss and decide the punishment UI 
                          It will be kind of slot machines, only one line will be chosen,
                          and text will roll random display a single line on the screen. 
                        
Weekend: Try to use ScrollView to implement infinity rolling. 
         It will use UGUI or unity 3D to implement. 
         (I have no idea about UGUI, because I did not have knowladge on this field.)
